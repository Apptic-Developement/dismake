# Creating Slash Commands

If you want to create a slash command (or interaction) using the Dismake library, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll show you how to get started with creating your first slash command.

### Defining the Command
To create an interaction, you need to define an asynchronous function and decorate it with the `@app.command()` decorator.

Here's an example:
```py {5,6,7} showLineNumbers copy filename="main.py"
import dismake

app = dismake.Bot(...)

@app.command(
    name="echo",
    description="A simple echo command."
)
async def echo_command(interaction: dismake.Interaction):
    await interaction.respond("Echo!")
```
import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Command names must be lowercase and can only contain `-`and `_` as special symbols and must not contain spaces.
</Callout>

In this example, we are creating an echo command using the `@app.command()` decorator.

Here's what's happening in each line of the code:

- We import the dismake library.
- We create a new instance of the `dismake.Bot` class and assign it to the `app` variable.
- We define an asynchronous callback function called `echo_command` and decorate it with the `@app.command()` decorator. The name argument is set to "echo" and the description argument is set to "A simple echo command."
The echo_command function takes an interaction object as its argument.
- We use the `interaction.respond` method to send a response message back to the user who invoked the command. In this case, the message is simply "Echo!"
