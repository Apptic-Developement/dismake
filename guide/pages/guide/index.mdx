# Introduction to Dismake

Dismake is a robust framework designed to assist you in developing stateless and independent Discord bots that employ Slash Commands. The framework is built on top of the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), a high-performance Python web framework, making it easy to use, efficient, and speedy.

## Getting Started with Dismake

Before you start using Dismake, you'll need to create a new Discord application and add a bot to it.

## Prerequisites

Dismake requires Python 3.9 or later versions to work correctly.

## Installing [#install]

To install Dismake, use the following command to install it directly from PyPI:

```bash copy
pip install dismake
```

## Creating a Minimal Discord Bot with Dismake

Let's create a basic bot that echoes user text back to them.

Create a new Python file named `main.py`, and copy and paste the following code:

```py copy filename="main.py" showLineNumbers
import dismake
from dismake import commands
import typing

app = dismake.Bot(...)

@app.event()
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {app.user}.")

@app.command(
    name="echo",
    description="A simple echo command."
)
async def echo_command(
    ctx: dismake.Interaction,
    text: typing.Annotated[
        str,
        commands.Option()
    ]
):
    await interaction.respond(f"{text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(app="main:app", reload=True)
```

The code above demonstrates how to use Dismake to create a basic Discord bot that responds to slash commands.

Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

- The first line imports the Dismake library. Make sure you've installed Dismake before you run the code.
- Next, we create a new instance of the Dismake.Bot class, which serves as our connection to Discord.
- We register an event using the Dismake.Bot.event() decorator. This library provides numerous events, and we use this callback to perform asynchronous operations once the bot is logged in.
- We register a slash command using the Dismake.Bot.command() decorator. This decorator requires the command's name and description as arguments.
- In the function that handles the command, we use the Dismake.Context object to interact with Discord. We take the user's input text and echo it back to them.
- Finally, we use the app.run() method to start the bot. We've named our bot app in this example. The second argument, reload=True, instructs Uvicorn to reload the app automatically when changes are made to the code.

To run the bot, open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and enter the following command:

```bash copy
python main.py
```

You can now experiment with your basic bot.
