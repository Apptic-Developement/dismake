[Dismake](https://github.com/PranoyMajumdar/dismake) is a robust framework designed to assist you in developing stateless and independent Discord bots that employ Slash Commands. The framework is built on top of the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), a high-performance Python web framework, making it easy to use, efficient, and speedy.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Dismake requires Python 3.9 or later versions to work correctly. 
- Discord Bot token 

## üèÅ Getting Started with Dismake
Before you start using Dismake, you'll need to create a new Discord application and add a bot to it.

### üíª Installing
To install Dismake, use the following command to install it directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install dismake
```

## ü§ñ Creating a Minimal Discord Bot with Dismake
Let's create a basic bot that echoes user text back to them.

Create a new Python file named `main.py`, and copy and paste the following code:

```py
import dismake
from dismake import commands
import typing

app = dismake.Bot(...)

@app.event('ready')
async def ready_event():
    print(f"Logged in as {app.user}.")

@app.command(
    name="echo",
    description="A simple echo command."
)
async def echo_command(
    ctx: dismake.Context, 
    text: typing.Annotated[
        str,
        commands.Option(name="text", description="Type something"), type=str
    ]
):
    await ctx.respond(f"{text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(app="main:app", reload=True)
 ```

The code above demonstrates how to use Dismake to create a basic Discord bot that responds to slash commands.

Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:

- The first line imports the Dismake library. Make sure you've installed Dismake before you run the code.
- Next, we create a new instance of the `Dismake.Bot` class, which serves as our connection to Discord.
- We register an event using the `Dismake.Bot.event()` decorator. This library provides numerous events, and we use this callback to perform asynchronous operations once the bot is logged in.
- We register a slash command using the `Dismake.Bot.command()` decorator. This decorator requires the command's name and description as arguments.
- In the function that handles the command, we use the Dismake.Context object to interact with Discord. We take the user's input text and echo it back to them.
- Finally, we use the `app.run()` method to start the bot. We've named our bot app in this example. The second argument, `reload=True`, instructs Uvicorn to reload the app automatically when changes are made to the code.

To run the bot, open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and enter the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

> You can now experiment with your basic bot.
