[Dismake](https://github.com/PranoyMajumdar/dismake) is a robust framework designed to assist you in developing stateless and independent Discord bots that employ Slash Commands. The framework is built on top of the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), a high-performance Python web framework, making it easy to use, efficient, and speedy.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Dismake requires Python 3.9 or later versions to work correctly. 
- Discord Bot token 

## üèÅ Getting Started with Dismake
Before you start using Dismake, you'll need to create a new Discord application and add a bot to it.

### üíª Installing
To install Dismake, use the following command to install it directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install dismake
```

## ü§ñ Creating a Minimal Discord Bot with Dismake
Let's create a basic bot that echoes user text back to them.

Create a new Python file named `main.py`, and copy and paste the following code:
```py
import dismake
import typing

app = dismake.Bot(...)

@app.event()
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {app.user!r}.")

@app.command(
    name="echo",
    description="A simple echo command."
)
async def echo_command(
    ctx: dismake.Context,
    text: typing.Annotated[
        str, dismake.Option(name="text", description="Type something")
    ]
):
    await ctx.respond(f"{text}")

```
Explanation:
1. Import the `dismake` library to access its functionality.
2. Create a new instance of the `dismake.Bot` class, `app`, which will represent the connection to Discord. Replace ... with the necessary parameters, such as your bot token.
3. Use the `@app.event()` decorator to register an `on_ready` event. This event will be triggered when the bot successfully logs in to Discord. In this example, the event handler simply prints a message indicating that the bot has logged in.
4. Use the `@app.command()` decorator to register a slash command. In this case, the command is named "echo" and has a description of "A simple echo command."
5. Define the function `echo_command` to handle the "echo" command. The function takes two parameters: `ctx` (the dismake.Context object) and text (annotated with `typing.Annotated[str, dismake.Option(name="text", description="Type something")]`). The annotation provides additional information for the command option, specifying its name and description.
7. Inside the `echo_command` function, use the `ctx.respond` method to send a response back to the user. In this case, the response is the echoed text.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Initialize and run.

To initialize a new dismake configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Open your console or terminal.
2. Run the command `dismake init`.
```bash
dismake init
```
3. You will be prompted with a question asking for the name of your bot variable.
```bash
? What is the name of your bot variable (app): app
```
4. Once you provide the bot variable name, dismake will generate a new file called `dismake.config.toml` for your project.
```bash
Successfully created a 'dismake.config.toml' file.
```
By following these steps, you will have successfully initialized a new dismake config file. 


To run the bot you need to run the following command in your console or terminal:
```
dismake run
```
